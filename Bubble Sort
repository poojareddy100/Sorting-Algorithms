Its an inplace Algorithm
O(n^2) is the time complexity
This Alogorithm degrades quickly.
This is stable algorithm.
lets say we are asked to sort the array {20, 35, -15, 7, 55, 1, 22}


approach: Basically here we maintain two partions of sorted as well as unsorted array. The size of sorted array keeps increasing with the iterations.
we move the greater element in the unsorted array to the right.

code

int[] arr= {20,35,-15,7,55,1,-22};
		int n=7;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			  for(int j=0;j<n-i-1;j++){
			     if(arr[j]>arr[j+1]){
			     int temp=arr[j];
			     arr[j]=arr[j+1];
			     arr[j+1]=temp;
			     }
			  }

			}
