This is an inplace algorithm.
The complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2).
This is an unstable algorithm.
This doesn't require as much as swapping as Bubble sort.

approach: here we make two partitions similar to Bubble sort. One partition includes sorted array and we take the largest or smallest element from the unsorted array we 
replace it with the selected element, consequently this adds element to the sorted array.

code:

  class Solution {
    public int[] sortArray(int[] arr) {
       for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
           int index=i;
           for(int j=i+1;j<arr.length;j++){
               if(arr[j]<arr[index]){
                   index=j;
               }
           }
           int temp=arr[i];
           arr[i]=arr[index];
           arr[index]=temp;
       }
        return arr;
    }
}
